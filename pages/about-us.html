<p class=ourinfo> Ayo! I'm Brent and I'm a second year Computer Science Game Design Major. It was super fun to work on this project
and collaborate with everyone. My top three favorite games right now are Valorant, League of Legends, and Apex Legends.
Other than play video games, I enjoy losing my fantasy basketball league every year and writing music.
I've been singing and playing instruments since I was nine years old and it continues to persist as my favorite pass time. </p>
