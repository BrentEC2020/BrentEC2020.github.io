<h1 class = helptitle> What YOU can do</h1>
<img class= climatelogo src="climatelogo.png">
<ul type=square>
	<li class = things>Walk or bike somewhere you’d normally drive.</li>
		<dd> Even parking your car and riding a bike the rest of the way to your destination
		can save fossil fuel emissions and introduce some exercise to your day. A 2015
		study by the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis found that a dramatic
		global increase in bicycling could reduce urban transportation emissions up to
		10 percent by 2050. </dd>
<br>
  <li class = things>Find alternatives to plastic whenever possible</li>
		<dd> Find and use reusable versions of appliances such as bottles, ziplock bags, plastic wrap, etc.
	 	and properly dispose of the plastic you do use to keep it out of our oceans and other waterways.
		Additionally,using reusable products may earn you a discount at some places! E.g: Many coffee
		shops are implementing a discount to customers who bring their own thermos or mug. <dd>
<br>
  <li class = things>Make more climate-friendly choices towards food.</li>
		<dd> The decisions we make about food can have a profound effect on the environment.
			Some options that are more eco-friendly include: Eating more meat-free meals
			(Factory farms feed cows grains, which cause them to release methane into the air
			through their gasses), buying organic and local whenever possible, creating a
			compost for food waste and scraps,  and growing your own food. </dd>
<br>
	<li class = things>Replace inefficient light bulbs.</li>
	<dd> Nearly 90% of the energy that powers a regular incandescent light bulb is
		converted to heat instead of light. This means that not only is a lot of energy
		wasted in the process of powering the bulb, but the bulb itself also puts off a
		lot of heat. Switching to LED light bulbs are better for the environment as they
		are more energy-efficient and last 20 times longer than incandescent or halogen bulbs,
		which as a result, fewer bulbs are produced. </dd>
<br>
	<li class = things> Call and meet with your representatives.</li>
	<dd> When people actively lobby their representatives, they are able to shed light
		on important issues such as that of the environment. In the United States, both
		chambers of Congress have established the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucuses.
		These caucuses are for members to discuss climate solutions and to work on climate legislation.
		Calling representatives and discussing environmental concerns may help push the
		proper actions to take place. </dd>
